# pd-stoplight

This is a set of scripts to control a stop light (traffic light) with a
raspberry pi and its gpio pins (external circuitry is yours to design - I use
a buffer and a set of solid state relays).  Originally the group I work for
used PagerDuty but since moved to OpsGenie for paging/alerting.  Both
scripts are included.

Copy settings.py-dist to settings.py and set the appropriate variables.
